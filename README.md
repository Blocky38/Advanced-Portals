Advanced Portals
================

An advanced portals plugin for bukkit made by sekwah41 designed to have a wide range of features which are easy to use.


Commands
================
/portal selector - give yourself the mighty portal axe, if UseOnlyServerMadeAxe is true then this one will still work but the normal iron axe will still be available to be used in survival for admins(instead of trying to always make portals)
/portal portal - give yourself a portal block
/portal select - punch inside a portal region and you will select that portal


/warp <destination> - a quick command to warp to a set destination(will add support for per-destination permissions)
